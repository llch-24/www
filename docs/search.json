These insights have the potential to inform coaching practices, player development initiatives, decision-making within the sport, ultimately improving the competitiveness and excitement of hockey.\nWe explored three research questions:\n\nHow do NHL teams differ in their ability to convert shots into goals, and how does this variation in goal conversion rates correlate with shot accuracy and effectiveness across different game periods?\nHow do NHL teams differ in their ability to convert shots into goals, and how does this variation in goal conversion rates correlate with shot accuracy and effectiveness across different game periods?\nIs there a “home-rink advantage” between home and away games for NHL teams, and to what extent, if any, does this effect exist?"
