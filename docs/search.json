These insights have the potential to inform coaching practices, player development initiatives, decision-making within the sport, ultimately improving the competitiveness and excitement of hockey.\nWe explored three research questions:\n\nHow do NHL teams differ in their ability to convert shots into goals, and how does this variation in goal conversion rates correlate with shot accuracy and effectiveness across different game periods?\nHow do NHL teams differ in their ability to convert shots into goals, and how does this variation in goal conversion rates correlate with shot accuracy and effectiveness across different game periods?\nIs there a “home-rink advantage” between home and away games for NHL teams, and to what extent, if any, does this effect exist?"

    "text": "This project focuses on streamlining the process of transitioning individuals from homeless shelters to permanent housing in collaboration with Pittsburgh DHS. Our team prototyped a logic-driven web interface to guide users to the appropriate housing programs based on their unique needs. We also designed an intake form to empower individuals to take greater control over their housing searches. Additionally, we conducted a survey and analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of joint versus separate program evaluations for improving program uptake and efficiency. This work aims to create a more user-centered and efficient housing support system."
