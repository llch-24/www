In this report, done in collaboration with the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program within Carnegie Mellon University's Statistics & Data Science Department, we explored the catalysts driving the mental health crisis in the United States. Using county-level data from the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, we modelled a linear regression to find the variables which most affect mental health across the US.
